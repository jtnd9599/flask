FLASK:

Flask is a web framework. This means flask provides you with tools, libraries and
technologies that allow you to build a web application. This web application can be
some web pages, a blog, a wiki or go as big as a web-based calendar application or a 
commercial website.

Flask is part of the categories of the micro-framework. Micro-framework are normally 
framework with little to no dependencies to external libraries. This has pros and cons.
Pros would be that the framework is light, there are little dependency to update and 
watch for security bugs, cons is that some time you will have to do more work by your
-self or increase yourself the list of dependencies by adding plugins. In the case of 
Flask, its dependencies are:

*Werkzeug a WSGI utility library
*jinja2 which is its template engine
